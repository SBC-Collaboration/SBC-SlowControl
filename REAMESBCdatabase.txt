This is a simple tutorial using SBC mysql database and SeeQ:
To be clear,
sentence in $$ means that this a command
words in <> means these are variables which can be replaced.

PART A: mysql tutorial

    1. Log into Database:
        run the command in terminal:
        $mysql -u <username> -p$
        replace the <username> with one of the username list in SBC google drive and log in with corresponding password

    2. Show all databases:
        run the command:
        $show databases;$
        (Don't forget the semicolon), in mysql language, commands or queries always end with semicolon.
        and this will show you all databases on local machine

    3. choose database:
        $use <Database name>;$
        this will allow you into one of the databases; You should run 'use SBCslowcontrol;'

    4. show the tables:
        $show tables;$
        this will show all tables in current database.
        in SBC slowcontrol database, there are 2 tables: DataStorage and MetaDataStorage.
        DataStorage is where we store all tags while MetaDataStorage store all tags' description.
        MetaDataStorage has another function -- pass tags into SeeQ, which we will talk about in SeeQ part.

    5.Check table's configuration
        $describe <table name>;$
        this will show the table's configuration and columns' names.

    6.Queries
        6.1 INSERT query
            $INSERT INTO <table name> VALUES (<value1>, <value2>, <value3>....<valuen>)$
            insert a row into certain table with table name <table name>
            <value1> to <valuen> are values in the row. n is the column number in the table
            for example:
            $INSERT INTO MetaDataStorage VALUES ("SERVO3321_EN", "Current state of Servo Valve's DO channel ", "BOOL");$
            also, you can insert multiple rows separated by comma:
            $INSERT INTO MetaDataStorage VALUES ("SERVO3321_EN", "Current state of Servo Valve's DO channel ", "BOOL"), ( "HTR6225_EN", "Current state of Heater's DO channel ", "BOOL");$
            this would be useful when you need to add tags into MetaDataStorage

        6.2 SELECT query
            6.2.1 SELECT with conditions
                $SELECT * FROM <table name> WHERE <column name>=<some column name>;$
                this will show all rows/tags with certain condition
                for example:
                SELECT * FROM DataStorage WHERE Instrument = "PV5305_OUT";
                this shows All output of PV5305.
                Table DataStorage has one column named Instrument and in this column, some tags' value are "PV5305_OUT"
            6.2.2 SELECT ALL
                if you want to show all data in the table, you can delete the parts after WHERE:
                $SELECT * from <table name>;$
            6.2.3 SELECT Last N numbers:
                $SELECT * FROM <TableName> ORDER BY <Key> DESC LIMIT <N>;$
                Show last N rows in the table with name <TableName>
                <Key> is the Primary key of the table. In DataStorage <Key>=ID.
                for example:
                $SELECT * FROM DataStorage ORDER BY ID DESC LIMIT 10;$
        6.3 Else
            There are other queries like DELETE, DROP and so on. But They are less frequently used. You can refer to them in official mysql tutorial
            https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/examples.html


    7. Table Structure
        Except from the result you could get from DESCRIBE commands, there are also some other configurations in our mysql Databases;

        7.1 For simple output, like PT, TT
            Their value in "Instrument" column in DataStorage table will be their PID like TT2111
        7.2 For multiple output like PV, HTR, SERVO
            They have multiple output which should be stored in DataStorage;
            Their value in "Instrument" column in DataStoarge table will in same form of PLC flags:
            https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMw5QIB-sNxmFlgcZvzEb_f5HN54hNN7TmSJeOfYYUk/edit#gid=0
            for example, the status of pneumatic valve is PVXXXX_OUT like PV5309_OUT
            the output status of PIDLOOP could be HTR1202_EN.



Part B SeeQ tutorial:
    1.log in
        To obtain the permission log into SeeQ, ask Eric Dahl and Mark A Knapp to give you the permission.
        Once you've done that. Log in on SBC slowcontrol machine
        http://ppd-webspace:34216/5BF9FA4D-40DB-466E-833A-6102D4B4C812/folder/
        Directory is Active Directory Fermilab
        email is your id@services.fnal.gov
        password should be same as your Fermilab services password
    2. Queries
        2.1 click "NEW" and select "WorkBench Analysis" on the topleft
        2.2 click "data"-> Types: Signal and Datasources: SBC Slow Control and search on the topleft
        2.3 On the bottomleft, there will be some tags appears. You can select one and plot them
    3. Configurations
        3.1 General Description
            SeeQ requires a configuration file to import data from mysql into SeeQ. Fortunately, we've passed the json file to Mark.
            The principle of the the configuration file is this: It will read all tags in MetaDataStorage and treat them as readable BOTH in DataStorage and MetaStorage.
            In other words, if you want to plot a signal in DataStorage table, a tag with same name must also appear in MetaDataStorage.
            For example,
            in DataStorage:
            |ID     | Instrument   | Timestamp           | Value|
            +-------+--------------+---------------------+------+
            |490853 | PV4324_OUT   | 2021-12-08 15:36:48 |     1|

            to import this row(and all rows containing PV4324_OUT), MetaDataStorage must contain:
            | Instrument | Description            | Unit |
            +------------+------------------------+------+
            | PV4324_OUT | Pneumatic Valve output | BOOL |

            and after add the tag in the MetaDataStorage, you should be able to plot PV4324_OUT in SeeQ

        3.2 Methods to add tags in MetaDataStorage:
            Refer to PART A 6.1
